Anal sex most often refers to the sex act involving insertion of the penis into the anus The term anal sex can also sometimes include other sexual acts involving the anus, including but not limited to anilingus and fingering
It is a form of sexual behavior considered to be comparatively high in risk, due to the vulnerability of the tissues and the septic nature of the anus As the rectal mucosa provides little natural lubrication, a personal lubricant is most often required or preferred when penetrating the anus
At the present time in Western countries anal sex is becoming an increasingly popular form of intercourse between men and women One reason is that there is very low risk of unwanted pregnancy via unprotected anal intercourse Also, anal sex is sometimes seen as preserving female virginity because it leaves the hymen intact Another reason is that the anus is considered to yield more tactile pleasure for the penis, being tighter than the vagina
The growing popularity of the practice, however, is claimed to be taking place in a climate of reduced sex education and fewer educational media outlets, leading to a lowered awareness of the health risks involved For example, the risk of injury during intercourse is many times higher than that during vaginal sex As a result, according to Judy Kuriansky, of Columbia University, "anal sex is a serious public problem"
Anal sex and female virginity
Though more often applied to first penetration, the concept of "technical virginity" is sometimes conceived as resting solely on vaginal penetration
Pegging
A woman using a strap-on dildo to anally penetrate a man is referred to as pegging Due to the proximity of the prostate gland to the rectum, it has been suggested that males may achieve greater satisfaction in this manner than females
Prevalence
The US Center for Disease Control determined, in a  survey, that the incidence of anal relations in the US heterosexual population is on the increase The survey showed that  percent of men and  percent of women between  and  had engaged in heterosexual anal sex; in  a similar survey found that only  percent of men  to  and  percent of women  to  had By way of comparison, seven times as many women as gay men engage in anal intercourse, a figure reflecting the greater overall heterosexual population" Another survey in  indicates that anal sex is on the rise amongst young people; the survey which focused on a much younger demographic of teens and young adults aged - found that  percent of  surveyed had had anal sex in the previous  months, with condoms being used % of the time However, given the subject matter the survey hypothesized that that figure was probably underestimated
Figures for prevalence can vary amongst different demographics, regions, and nationalities A  French survey of five hundred female respondents concluded that a total of % had practiced anal sex, though only one third of these claimed to have enjoyed the experience In contrast, in a  South Korean survey of  women, only % of respondents reported having had anal sex
Figures for the prevalence of sexual behavior can also fluctuate over time Edward O Laumann's  survey, reported in The Social Organization of Sexuality: Sexual Practices in the United States found that about % of heterosexuals have engaged in anal sex Sex researcher Alfred Kinsey, working in the s, had found that number to be closer to % at the time More recently, a researcher from the University of British Columbia in  put the number of heterosexuals who have practiced anal sex at between % and %
According to Columbia University's health website, Go Ask Alice!: "Studies indicate that about  percent of heterosexual couples have had anal sex at least once, and  percent regularly have anal penetration"
Homosexual
th-century erotic interpretation of Hadrian and Antinous, by Paul Avril
Historically, anal sex has been popularly associated with male homosexuality and men who have sex with men (MSM) However, many MSM do not engage in anal sex, and some groups such as frot advocacy groups actively denounce anal sex as degrading toward the receptive partner and an unnecessary health risk This viewpoint cites the increased HIV risk and physiological differences of the anus from the vagina
Among MSM who do have anal sex, the insertive partner is referred to as the top or active partner The man being penetrated is referred to as the bottom or passive partner Preference for either is referred to as versatile
Prostate stimulation
In the receiving partner, being penetrated can produce a pleasurable sensation due to the inserted penis rubbing or brushing against the prostate through the anal wall Penetration can be painful if the bottom partner's anus is not properly lubricated
The prostate gland (also known as the "male G-spot" or "A-spot") can be stimulated during anal intercourse
Stimulation of the prostate gland can result in pleasurable sensations and can lead to a distinct type of orgasm in some cases The prostate is located next to the rectum and is the larger, more developed male homologue to the Skene's glands, which are believed to be connected to the female "G-spot" The Skene's glands are sometimes referred to as the "female prostate"; they are located around the urethra and can be felt through the wall of the vagina
Prevalence
While at the present time it is reported more frequently among same-sex couples, according to Dr John Dean and Dr David Delvin, "in absolute numbers, it is hypothesized that more heterosexual couples have anal sex than homosexual couples"
The prevalence of anal sex among homosexual couples in the West has varied over time Magnus Hirschfeld, in his  magnum opus, The Homosexuality of Men and Women reports the rate of anal sex among homosexual men surveyed to be %, the least favored of all the practices documented
By the s in the United Kingdom, it was thought that about fifteen percent of male homosexuals practiced the method The Gay Urban Men's Study (PI Stall, UCSF) and the Young Men's Study (YMS, PI Osmond/Catania, UCSF), indicate that % of men surveyed engage in anal sex The Laumann study claims that % of gay men practice it, while the remaining % never engage in it at all
A survey conducted from  to  in San Francisco by the Stop AIDS Project indicated that over the course of the study, among men who have sex with men, the proportion engaging in anal sex increased from % to %
Health risks
Mucous membranes of the rectum
Anal sex exposes participants to two principal dangers: infections, due to the high number of infectious microorganisms not found elsewhere on the body, and physical damage to the anus and the rectum due to their vulnerability
Recent reports have documented that risky behavior is on the rise among men who have sex with men Likewise, among men who have sex with women, a  study of socially and sexually active Puerto Rican men indicated that of the more than % who reported having anal sex with women, very few had used condoms Among gay men, anal sex without the use of a condom is referred to as barebacking
HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases
Among the diseases with which anal sex is associated are HIV, human papilloma virus (HPV) (which can increase risk for anal cancer) typhoid fever and various diseases associated with the infectious nature of fecal matter or sexual intercourse in general Among these are: amoebiasis; chlamydia; cryptosporidiosis; E coli infections; giardiasis; gonorrhea; hepatitis A; hepatitis B; hepatitis C; herpes simplex; human papillomavirus; Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (HHV-); lymphogranuloma venereum; pubic lice; salmonellosis; shigella; syphilis; tuberculosis
The high concentration of white blood cells around the rectum, together with the risk of cuts to the rectum and that one of the functions of the rectum is to absorb fluid, increases the risk of HIV transmission because the HIV retrovirus reproduces within the immune system's T-cells/CD cells Use of condoms and other precautions are a medically recommended way to lessen risk of infections Unprotected receptive anal sex is the most risky sexual behavior in terms of HIV transmission
Increased risk of anal cancer due to HPV
Most cases of anal cancer are related to infection with the human papilloma virus The incidence of the disease has jumped % in men and % in women in the last thirty years, according to a  American study The increase is attributed to changing trends in sexual behavior and tobacco use Current use of tobacco increased the incidence of anal cancer fourfold, while a history of multiple sex partners (fifteen or more) or receptive anal sex increased the incidence sevenfold
Physical damage
Physical damage to the rectum and anus can manifest as generalized ano-rectal trauma, hemorrhoids, anal fissures, and rectal prolapse An insufficient amount of lubricant can make it especially painful or injurious Damage is more likely if intercourse is forcible or aggressive, if alcohol or other drugs have dulled sensitivity, if communication is poor, or if technique is clumsy
Anal incontinence
Loss of control over the bowels, though rare according to some, is thought to be a valid concern and is reported to be caused by repeated injury, or by the insertion of large objects, or simply by regular anal sex, which "leads to internal sphincter dilation and soiling"
A  study published in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine found that fourteen out of a sample of forty men receiving anal intercourse experienced episodes of frequent anal incontinence However, a  study published in the American Journal of Gastroenterology found no difference in levels of incontinence between homosexual men who engaged in anal sex and heterosexual men who did not, and criticised the earlier study for its inclusion of flatulence in its definition of incontinence
Dr Jack Morin recommended kegel exercises to prevent loss of muscle tone from anal fisting or insertion of large objects in a presentation of clinical aspects of anal sexuality, delivered at the  joint conference of the Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality and the American Association of Sex Educators He added, however, that he had never personally observed "loosening" in any of his patients
Cultural issues
A shunga print depicting a man and a youth
Historically, a number of cultures have recorded the practice of anal intercourse between men The males who participated in such relationships often did not do so exclusively, as participation in these relationships between men did not preclude sex with women Such relations have also been documented as taking place in houses of prostitution, which provided youths or young men
Ancient and non-Western cultures
The term "Greek love" has long been used to refer to the practice, and in modern times, "doing it the Greek way" is sometimes used as slang for anal sex However, homosexual anal sex was far from a universally accepted practice in Ancient Greece It was the target of jokes in surviving comedies; Aristophanes mockingly alludes to the practice, claiming that "Most citizens are europroktoi (wide-arsed) now" While pedagogic pederasty was an essential element in the education of male youths, these relationships, at least in Athens and Sparta, were expected to steer clear of penetrative sex of any kind There are very few works of pottery or other art that display anal sex between older men and boys, let alone with adult men Most such works depict fondling or intercrural sex, which was not condemned for violating and feminizing the boys Other sources make it clear that the practice was criticized as shameful, and seen as a form of hubris
Two Roman males in a lupanar; Warren Cup, British Museum
In later Roman age Greek poetry, anal sex became a common topos, represented as taking place with "eligible" youths: those who had attained the proper age but had not yet become adults Seducing children into the practice was considered very shameful for the adult, and having such relations with a male who was no longer adolescent was considered more shameful for the young male than for the one mounting him Greek courtesans, or hetaerae, are said to have frequently practiced heterosexual anal intercourse as a means of preventing pregnancy The acceptability of anal sex thus varied with the time-period and the location, as Ancient Greece spanned a long time and stretched over three continents and two major seas
For a male citizen to take the passive (or receptive) role in anal intercourse was condemned in Rome as an act of impudicitia (immodesty or unchastity) Free men, however, frequently took the active role with a young slave, known as a catamite or puer delicatus In fact the Romans thought of anal sex as something specifically "Greek," although Roman men often availed themselves of their own slaves or others in this way
In Japan, records (including detailed shunga) show that at least some men in relationships with other men did engage in penetrative anal intercourse
Man and woman having anal sex Ceramic, Moche Culture  AD Larco Museum Collection
Evidence suggestive of widespread heterosexual anal intercourse in a pre-modern culture can be found in the erotic vases, or stirrup-spout pots, made by the Moche people of Peru; in a survey of a collection of these pots, it was found that  percent of them depicted heterosexual anal intercourse, more by far than any other sex act Moche pottery of this type belonged to the world of the dead, which was believed to be a reversal of life Thus the reverse of common practices was often portrayed The Larco Museum houses an Erotic Gallery in which this pottery is showcased
The th century anthropologist Richard Francis Burton has theorized that there is a geographical Sotadic zone wherein penetrative intercourse between men is particularly prevalent and accepted; moreover he was one of the first writers to advance the premise that such an orientation is biologically determined
Western cultures
In many Western countries, anal sex has generally been taboo since the Middle Ages when heretical movements were sometimes attacked by accusations that their members practised anal sex among themselves At that time the mainstream Christian clergy was not celibate, but the highest orders of some heretical sects were, leading to rumours that their celibacy was a sign of their attraction to members of the same sex The term buggery originated in medieval Europe as an insult used to describe the rumoured same-sex sexual practices of the heretics from a sect originating in Bulgaria, where its followers were called bogomils; when they spread out of the country they were called buggres (from the ethnonym Bulgars) Another term for the practice, more archaic, is "pedicate" from the Latin pedicare, with the same meaning
The Renaissance poet Pietro Aretino advocated the practice in his Sonetti Lussuriosi (Lust Sonnets)
While men who engaged in homosexual relationships were generally suspected of engaging in anal sex, many such individuals did not Among these, in recent times, have been André Gide, who found it repulsive; and Noel Coward, who had a horror of disease, and asserted when young that "I'd never do anything - well the disgusting thing they do - because I know I could get something wrong with me"
In different religions
François-Rolland Elluin, Sodomites provoking divine wrath, from Le pot-pourri ()
This prohibition of the Abrahamic religions against anal sex has been promulgated under the rubric of "sodomy," which includes various other transgressions of a sexual nature, whether with men, women or animals This idea is vividly brought to life in the popular interpretation of the story of Sodom, where the people were prone to sexual immorality, and as a result were destroyed There are conflicting views as to why Sodom was destroyed
Judaism
Orthodox Judaism teaches that homosexual anal sex is a sin, a toevah (abomination) This teaching is from the Biblical passages of Leviticus : and :; the injunction "Do not lie with a man the lyings of a woman; it is abhorrent" has led rabbinical scholars to conclude "these verses to prohibit anal sex between men without any exception" The Conservative, Reform and Reconstructionist branches of Judaism are accepting of homosexuality, but less so of sodomy However, Judaism permits heterosexual anal sex
Christianity
In Christian countries it has often been referred to euphemistically as the peccatum contra naturam (the sin against nature, after Thomas Aquinas) or Sodomitica luxuria (sodomitical lusts, in one of Charlemagne's ordinances), or peccatum illud horribile, inter christianos non nominandum (that horrible sin that among Christians is not to be named) Christian religions disapprove of anal sex, although the degree of disapprobation varies greatly between denominations
Islam
Main article: Islamic view of anal sex
Liwat, or the sin of Lot's people, is officially prohibited by most Islamic sects There are parts of the Qur'an which talk about smiting on Sodom and Gomorrah, and this is thought to be a reference to unnatural sex, and so there are hadith and Islamic laws which prohibit it Practitioners of anal relations are called luti and are seen as criminals in the same way that a thief is a criminal, meaning that they are giving in to a universal temptation Liwat with a woman is known as lesser liwat and with a man as greater liwat
Buddhism
There is no explicit prohibition against anal sex in Buddhist teachings However, as the Buddha left very few absolute prohibitions against specific human conduct and principally encouraged the repetition of right action as a way to enlightenment and the gaining of positive karma, it is commonly considered within Buddhist teaching to be inconsistent with Buddhist precepts and principles
Fisting is a sexual activity that involves inserting a hand into the vagina or rectum
 Typically, fisting does not involve forcing the clenched fist into the vagina or rectum
 Instead, all five fingers are kept straight and held as close together as possible (forming a beak-like shape, casually referred to as a "silent duck"), then slowly inserted into a well-lubricated vagina or rectum
 Once insertion is complete, the fingers either naturally clench into a fist or remain straight
 In more vigorous forms of fisting, such as "punching," a fully clenched fist may be inserted and withdrawn slowly
 Fistees who are more experienced may take two fists (double-fisting) in the vagina or rectum
 In the case of double-fisting, pleasure is derived more from the stretching of the anus or vaginal wall rather than from the thrusting (in-and-out) movement of hands
Fisting has been performed on (and by) both men and women; gay, straight and otherwise
 While fisting remains unexplored by many people, the ones who do have developed three main techniques: Silent Duck, Double Fist/Side Prayer, and the My Hand In Your Pockets
The Silent Duck is the technique most often used, where the person engaging in hand insertion makes a beak-like shape with their hand resembling a duck
 Double Fist/Side Prayer is a very advanced technique which only few are capable of achieving
 The person engaging in hand insertion (the fister) places their hands palm to palm forming a position similar to one used when praying
 Handler then turns theirs parallel to the floor, pointing fingers towards subject's vagina or anus
Butt plugs are sex toys designed to be inserted in the anus and rectum for sexual pleasure
 In some ways, they are similar to a dildo, but they tend to be shorter, and to have a flared end to prevent the device from being lost inside the rectum
 (Many dildos lack a flared end, and thus it is ill-advised to use such dildos anally, since they may get stuck, requiring medical extraction
)
Unlike the vagina, which is closed off by the cervix, the rectum leads to the sigmoid colon
 Objects that are inserted into the rectum can therefore potentially travel up into the bowel: the flared end on a butt plug exists to prevent this
In addition, the lower bowel above the rectum is easily perforated
For this reason, butt plugs tend to be shorter than dildos, and their marked size generally indicates the circumference of the device rather than the length
 They must also be very smooth to avoid damaging the rectum or bowel
 In order to get them into the rectum, they most commonly have a general profile of a round-ended cone which then narrows to a "waist" which locates itself at the anal sphincter, with the flared part outside the body, preventing the butt plug from slipping further into the body
 The sphincter muscle will hold the plug in place by the waist, preventing the plug from slipping out unintentionally
As with other activities involving anal penetration, such as anal sex, large amounts of sexual lubricant and a slow gentle approach are often needed to insert or remove a butt plug
Butt plugs are often used covered by condoms for hygiene, and to allow for the easy disposal of any feces that they may come in contact with
 Nevertheless, they should not be shared with other people, due to the risk of blood-borne diseases, including HIV that can arise from the transfer of body fluids from one person to another
 A butt plug is not necessarily confined to only anal stimulation
 Butt plugs may be transferred and rotated to and from the rectum, vagina, and mouth
 This is quite an unsanitary way to engage in sexual stimulation unless certain precautions are made; such as cleaning the butt plug in an anti-bacterial fashion by e
g
 alcohol, the vagina being covered in plastic wrap, the buttplug being covered by a condom (which is removed before any transferring takes place), and other various methods
 If these measures are not taken, fecal matter may be passed to other parts of the body causing sickness, infections, and a malodorous scent
Designs
Butt plugs come in a variety of colors, shapes, sizes, and textures
 Some are designed to look like penises, while some are ribbed or wavy
 The majority, however, shaped as shown in the picture above, with a thin tip, which is wider in the middle, a notch to hold it in place once it is inserted, and a flared base to prevent complete insertion into the rectum
 Some plugs are designed (long, flexible and curved) to penetrate the sigmoid colon
Butt plugs are made of a variety of materials, the most common being latex
 Other materials used include silicone, neoprene, wood, metal, glass, stone, and many other materials
 Silicone is a particularly good material, as it can be disinfected in boiling water
There are butt plugs that "ejaculate" by squirting water or other viscous fluids into the rectum
 There are also vibrating butt plugs, and butt plugs that can inflate and expand
 Some butt plugs are specifically designed for men and stimulate the prostate
 Other butt plugs are manufactured with long hair or simulated animal tails attached to the base for use in human pony play or other animal fantasy role play
Butt plugs can be moved in or out for pleasure; for this type of activity ribbed butt plugs can increase pleasure
 They can also be worn continuously (or be lockable) for long periods of time
Risks
When wearing butt plugs and holding the anal sphincter open for very long periods of time one should take care, as this practice could potentially decrease the elasticity of the anal sphincter muscles
The BMEzine risks glossary states that "The process is similar to earlobe stretch except that the 'jewellery'  is not worn all the time" and that there is no harm done to the function of the sphincter when stretching is done carefully
 Kegel exercises can help maintain normal, healthy sphincter function
