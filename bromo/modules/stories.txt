alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought alice 'without pictures or conversation?'
so she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her
there was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to itself, 'oh dear! oh dear! i shall be late!' (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge
in another moment down went alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again
the rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well
either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next
first, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs
she took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled 'orange marmalade', but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it
'well!' thought alice to herself, 'after such a fall as this, i shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! how brave they'll all think me at home! why, i wouldn't say anything about it, even if i fell off the top of the house!' (which was very likely true)
down, down, down
would the fall never come to an end! 'i wonder how many miles i've fallen by this time?' she said aloud
'i must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth
let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, i think--' (for, you see, alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) '--yes, that's about the right distance--but then i wonder what latitude or longitude i've got to?' (alice had no idea what latitude was, or longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say)
presently she began again
'i wonder if i shall fall right through the earth! how funny it'll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward! the antipathies, i think--' (she was rather glad there was no one listening, this time, as it didn't sound at all the right word) '--but i shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know
please, ma'am, is this new zealand or australia?' (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke--fancy curtseying as you're falling through the air! do you think you could manage it?) 'and what an ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking! no, it'll never do to ask: perhaps i shall see it written up somewhere'
down, down, down
there was nothing else to do, so alice soon began talking again
'dinah'll miss me very much to-night, i should think!' (was the cat)
'i hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time my dear! i wish you were down here with me! there are no mice in the air, i'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know
but do cats eat bats, i wonder?' and here alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, 'do cats eat bats? do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, 'do bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either question, it didn't much matter which way she put it
she felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, 'now, dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over
alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the white rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it
there was not a moment to be lost: away went alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, 'oh my ears and whiskers, how late it's getting!' she was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof
there were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again
suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them
however, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!
alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw
how she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway; 'and even if my head would go through,' thought poor alice, 'it would be of very little use without my shoulders
oh, how i wish i could shut up like a telescope! i think i could, if i only know how to begin
' for, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible
there seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, ('which certainly was not here before,' said alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words 'drink me' beautifully printed on it in large letters
it was all very well to say 'drink me,' but the wise little alice was not going to do that in a hurry
'no, i'll look first,' she said, 'and see whether it's marked "poison" or not'; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked 'poison,' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later
however, this bottle was not marked 'poison,' so alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off
'what a curious feeling!' said alice; 'i must be shutting up like a telescope
and so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden
first, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; 'for it might end, you know,' said alice to herself, 'in my going out altogether, like a candle
i wonder what i should be like then?' and she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing
after a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried
'come, there's no use in crying like that!' said alice to herself, rather sharply; 'i advise you to leave off this minute!' she generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people
'but it's no use now,' thought poor alice, 'to pretend to be two people! why, there's hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person!'
soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words 'eat me' were beautifully marked in currants
'well, i'll eat it,' said alice, 'and if it makes me grow larger, i can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, i can creep under the door; so either way i'll get into the garden, and i don't care which happens!'
she ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, 'which way? which way?', holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way
so she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake
When Yard headed for the execution ground, he was followed by Lightfoot Sue
she was not one of his female admirers
rather, she was a spy for the assassination squad which had been tasked with the job of concluding the life of this prince of the blood
sue, known to most people as lightfootsy,  was not particularly good at what she did
this was not surprising
she was slightly mentally defective, though you wouldn't know it from looking at her
to look at, she was an attractive sheila with glossy black hair, good child-bearing hips and big boobies, really bouncy udders (boing boing!) that would be fun if you ended up getting between the sheets and doing the mattress accordion with her
lightfootsy, despite her good looks, was a slow learner, had difficulty staying on task, and did not find it easy to learn new things
she was not exactly unemployable
she certainly had a good understanding of the commercial possibilities of her personal flower vase
additionally, her two frontmost teeth, top and bottom, had been removed to produce a big-gapped smile which was designed to send a clear message to males of the species: hey, big boy, here's a mouth that really knows the meaning of the world welcome
but, though lightfootsy was prepared to sell her body, and sometimes did, in the city of ataturk, which had any number of dirty-minded avaricious sluts competing for the discretionary dime, being miss oral hotel or miss pork hole did not pay off as well as you might think it would
the hospitality industry, as it was locally called, was intensely competitive
so lightfootsy had ended up becoming a night porter
this was a job you had to do not by night but in the clear light of day, because it was all too easy to make mistakes if you were dealing with "the product" in the gloom of the night
in stature's, a city which had no sewer system, a night porter was someone who worked in the night soil removal business, showing up to take away the contents of the household's central honeypot, into which commodes would be emptied after they had been used
you moved your bowels? well, now you've got to pay someone to take the product away
unless you want to hike all the way to the river and dump your dump yourself
technically, it was illegal to treat the streets of the city as a sewer, though quite a few people did
people aside, the city was also afflicted by coiled cow pats sourced from cows (all of which were sacred to the religion known as indira), the droppings of dogs, the dung of horses and the manure of the occasional elephant and camel
oh, yes, and the occasional elephant
don't forget the elephants
however, while a few delinquents did use the city streets as a discarding zone for human wastes, most of the citizens of stature's were goodish, if not actually good, and they paid for night porters to uplift their household product and dispose of it in a sanitary manner by dumping it into vomulus or orlid, the twin rivers which lay immediately to the east and west of ilkliglup, the elevated area on which the city of stature's was built
that was lightfootsy's routine work, then: taking unpleasant wet stuff from place a to place b
her sideline was helping with the work of killing people
dealing with wet stuff and helping out with wetwork are both simple tasks that can be done by those who labor through life under severe limitations
as a rule, those who become professional killers are by no means the brightest and the best
they do what they do because they can
it lies within their sphere of competence
killings r us can make good use of you if your talents are as limited as the ability to walk up behind someone on a crowded street and, while they're not looking, bash them over the head with a bit of rock
even if you're as dumb as gerbil's poke hole, the murder machine has a niche for you
having found an ecological niche in the environment of extermination, lightfootsy was, unfortunately, making a hash of things
following yard should have been even within lightfootsy's limited abilities, but she messed it up
she drew attention to herself by coming right up close, close enough to slip a piece of cold steel between his ribs, then falling back again
by this odd behavior, she drew attention to herself, and people figured out that she, miss big boobies, and he, the most famous wrestler in stature's, were an item
at first, yard was oblivious to the fact that he was being followed
he took a relaxed attitude to life and did not waste his time getting stressed or paranoid
for pelican ostragoth yard, life was a picnic, a long day out at the funpark
in proof of the picnic, he had an actual picnic sack with him, the essentials for the snack-snooze afternoon he was planning for the garden
gym in the morning, entertainment in the middle of the day, a private picnic in the afternoon - an ideal day in what was, all things considered, an ideal life
got me my pocket money, got me my beer buddies, got me my share of pretty spread-mes, what more do i need?
yard, the stalkee, had, at first, no inkling that he was being stalked
but then he started to see grinning males of the species making the thumb-in-fist gesture which, locally, meant "like your floozie, boy way to go!"
from the repeated use of that gesture by people who could see what was behind him, yard figured out that a girl fan had tagged along behind him
he chose not to encourage her by turning around to see who she was
with three or four girlfriends on his hands (if you laid a babe once, was she really your girlfriend, or just a one-time lucky hit?) yard had no wish whatsoever for any entanglements with his female fan base
if miss following floozie was still dogging his footsteps when he made it to sunvoyage square, then he would introduce her to brother bloke, who would necessarily be there for the proceedings
bloke was a ladies' man through and through, never too busy to add one more bedroom canyon to his workload
coming up ahead were the two monstrously huge winged rabbits, each lighthouse tall, which landmarked unch hauzen, the entrance to sunvoyage square
these ancient monuments were grim souvenirs from the age, centuries ago, when kendaman culture had been dominated by mayazclapa, a cult of human sacrifice
how things had changed!
each rabbit was mounted on a plinth, with a ziggurat of steps leading up to the foot of the thing
both rabbits were standing on their hind legs, each clutching something in its paws
the rabbit on the left was holding a flower
it was a female rabbit and went by the name of beatrice
the rabbit on the right was male, and was known as glong mungus
originally it had held a carrot in its paws, though now only the stump of that symbolic object remained
standing slap bang in the middle of unch hauzen, broadside on to the incoming throng, was an elephant
a humpty up, not a humpty down
elephants come in two types, one with a back that dips down and the other with a back which is convex
this nellie boots was of the convex type, a humpty up
whitewashed on the elephant's flank was a name: andy warhol
in the kingdom of kendama, andy warhol was the god of gay sex
in kendama, it was not, technically, illegal to be a male homosexual
but, that granted, the physical expression of such a proclivity was forbidden
on pain of death
unless - this was the one loophole that the constitution provided - having man-man sex was an integral part of your religion
if you were one of andy warhold's devotees, a warholite, then you would have such a religious obligation
for you, the rigors of the dark and constricted channel known to coreligionists as the narrow road to the deep north would be the true path, the royal road to ecstasy, nirvana and enlightenment
the framers of the constitution had, in all probability, imagined that the number of men who were under a religious obligation to hump other men would be vanishingly small, but, in the kingdom of kendama, a full ten percent of all males fourteen and over were registered as warholites
the three-way choice being death, chastity or religious conviction, pretty much every gay who acknowledged his own nature had chosen the path of piety, with one consequence being that, in kendama, ostentatious religiosity was always and inevitably associated with male homosexuality
in addition to being the name of a god, andy warhol was also the name of ataturk's leading male brothel
in the days of the former king, yard's paternal grandfather, king engroshab, the king himself had been, notoriously, a regular client, his three-way fancy being for older men, very young boys (it would be a criminal offense for me to tell you precisely how young) and corpses
in the days of king david, however, the monarchy was aggressively heterosexual, which was why king david had arranged for the phallus of his personal god, rafrica, to be installed in the shrine known as glastonbury, so its potentiating powers could be used to optimize the commitment of kendama's females to the phallocentric hierarchy
seeing the elephant with its whitewashed andy warhol sign triggered a chain of associations in yard's mind, these including both is straitlaced hetero father and his seriously perverted gay paternal grandfather
thus distracted, he quite forgot that he was being followed
oblivious to footdogging danger, he approached unch hauzen and its flanking rabbits, beatrice and glong mungus
the beatrice steps were, as always, crowded with flower sellers
the flowers they hawked were always big, huge, profligate with perfume and color
golden sunflowers, swooning lilies, gaudy emerald galdazinias and rainbow tulips the size of a six-month baby
when it came to the floral world, kendaman culture had no use whatsoever for the tiny and the delicate
its taste in ikebana was as raucous as its taste in booze binges and backroom orgies
sitting up there on the beatrice steps amidst the imperious flowers was billy bison, gayest of the gay boys, as sexually aberrant as a three-legged drainpipe
if you were to strip him naked for a body search, you would find his male homosexuality betrayed by the three sacred tokens of the warholites
one was his special sacred underwear, a turquoise jockstrap
(in kendama, turquoise was a color always and inevitably associated with male homosexuality
) another giveaway sign of gay homosexuality was his toenails, painted a bright red
and the third? the third was his so-called angel's tooth, the miniature phallus that he wore around his neck on a silver chain
as billy sat there, he was eating, shamelessly, a lapastridenta sugar cone, choicest of the confectioneries to be found in the city of stature's
in so indulging, he was putting his poofqueer nature on display, for, in kendaman culture, sweet things were only for women, children and gays
real men, by contrast, favored the sour, the spicy and the salty
billy was up there on the lookout for the adored one, the oiled wrestler who was the focus on his nightly masturbatory fantasies
and there he was, with miss stinks-of-fish tagging along behind him, a big-boobed egg bearer walking a respectful one pace behind, as a woman should, not like these shameless sluts you see on the streets in this degenerate age, strutting along side by side with their boys, as if imagining that they themselves were human beings, rather than what they really are, which is breeding meat, wombs on forked legs
in billy's nightly fantasies, pelican yard was a male prostitute in andy warhol, and a slave prostitute at that, a rent boy who had no option but to let billy shaft him right up the poop pipe
but now miss cunt and boobies was muscling in on billy's territory
well, bitch girl, i think you and me need to have a bit of a face-to-face
not having you snatching my man, he's mine
yeah, cuntslave, a little chat, that's what we're going to have
somewhere private, i think
enjoy your face while you've got it, bitch
might wake up tomorrow to find that what you remember is gone
billy was most sincerely in love with yard, more fiercely in love than he had ever been before in his entire life
he believed, ardently, that love conquers all
if he loved yard hard enough, then, eventually, yard would be his
and it would be poop hole party time
though billy came across as soft, in bed he was very much the aggressor, always demanding the dominant role, always the shafter, never the shaftee
being butt fucked, well, billy had let a guy do that to him once, and it had hurt like hell
never again! butt fucking other guys, however, gee, wow, that was a blast
did billy have his ichorite assassin's knife with him? yep
it was there in the boot sheath, where it should be
one quick stab, miss likes-to-fuck-dogs, and you're done for
you're dead meat
with that in mind, billy started down the beatrice steps, making for yard and the fishy sauce pot which was following him
but billy's heroic mission to rescue yard from the enemy eggbearer came to a crashing halt almost immediately
descending the beatrice steps in an impetuous rush, he lost his footing and fell forward
he smashed right into a tray of extremely expensive norgalookas, brilliant blue and gold flowers which filled his world with the smell of honey as his bodyweight ruptured them
the flowers that billy had just gone and destroyed were the property nostradama haunch, who was not known as big mama brawler for nothing, and an altercation ensued
billy, being by far the lighter of the pair, was soon face down with big mama on top of him, her harpy hands physically tearing his hair out by the roots, causing him to scream piteously
meantime, on the heights of the glong mungus steps, traven, chief assassin in the drama of the wetworking of pelican yard, was already on his feet, heading downwards
traven was vaguely aware that someone was screaming on the beatrice steps, some hysterical flower-selling female, no doubt, but that was not what had motivated him to stand and head downhill
rather, he was aiming to intercept lightfoot sue as soon as possible
lightfootsy's mission had been dead simple, too simple for anyone to screw it up
or so traven had thought
just tag along behind yard and make sure that he, as expected, goes from his morning gym session to the execution which is going to provide the day's entertainment
but lightfootsy, the dumb bitch, had obviously fucked up bigtime, the evidence for this being the conga line of little boys which had fallen in behind her
in that press of people, maintaining a conga line took quite some doing, but the kids were evidently dedicated to the cause
it was glaringly clear that lightfootsy had, somehow, betrayed the fact that she was following yard, though yard, who was bulling his way through the increasingly tight crowd, had a big shit-eating grin plastered right across his relaxed festival face, which suggested that he had no idea that he was quarry, prey, rape meat waiting to be slaughtered
despite the urgency of the moment, traven descended slowly
it would be unwise to descend the glong mungus steps in a hurry because, as always, they were being used for outdoor cookery
various women were cooking rotipan, the onion bread that was one of the staples of the kendaman poor, over burning cow pats
this is one of the really great things about cow dung: you can set fire to it, and, once it's burning, you can use it to cook
(for a full rundown of the glories of cow pats, refer to bovinataurus, sacred book of the indirans
)
the smoke in the air had the effect of amplifying the heat of the sun, which was making the black basalt of the glong mungus steps intolerably hot
picking his way down through the womenfolk, traven had a brilliant idea
give lightfootsy a knife
tell her to shove it into yard's back
she was dumb enough to do that
yard would be dead, and the mob, enraged by the assassination of a prince of the blood, would tear lightfootsy limb to limb
which would be a good thing because she, evidently, was a security breach just waiting to happen
