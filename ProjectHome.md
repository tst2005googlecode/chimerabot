**Chimera**

Chimera is a modular IRC bot framework that is being actively developed on [LuaSocket](http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/~diego/professional/luasocket/)
.

Horribly commented and full of ugly code for the moment, when a few things get patched up the code will get primped and polished.

Only SVN is up for now.  An archive will be added before too long.
